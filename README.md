# Chirality (MirrorMod)

*Hi there Miss Strimer can you play the hardest map in the game Reality Check Through the Skull but it's the inverse?*

Or, ever played true acc in the sky? What about worm curls?

**A generative mod that creates inverted (horizontal, vertical, true, or mirror-inversed) maps for for any non-360/90 map.
Available for Standard, OneSaber, NoArrows and Lawless modes with ScoreSaber submission or Party Mode (and OST / select DLCs for pre-1.20.0 only). Each map can potentially generate 16 new characteristics!**

**v2.0.0: Now with Arcs and Chains! Plus Invert True mode!**

  <b><i>Ov but it's the inverse - Will you put your name on the board?</i></b>
</p>

## New Game Modes / Characteristics
- **Invert Left-Right:** Horizontal component of arrows are mirrored
- **Invert Up-Down:** Vertical component arrows are mirrored
- **Invert True:** Both horizontal and vertical of arrows are mirrored
- **Inverse:** Map is mirrored over the diagonal axis, including colors, lanes and rows
- **Invert modes can generate lolloppes, worm curls, reverse chains, and disembodied chains out of stacks and burst sliders.** This is by design üòÅ Inverse mode is free of lolloppes, reverse sliders etc
- **ME and maps with precision placement will activate the shittech mode.** Yes, what you see in-game is intentional and deterministic ü§£. Rest assured you can play on the leaderboards of these maps

## How To Use
- Place Chirality.dll in Plugins folder
- Click on any map, try the 4 new game modes and have fun! Inverted True and Inverse modes can be pure chaos for some maps ^^
- To change between Standard, OneSaber, NoArrows and Lawless: Go to Mod Settings. You must click OK to apply the changes. (Pre-1.20.0 only: Changing modes for OST/DLC requires a game restart after clicking OK to take effect).
- To enable or disable the mod: Go to Mod Settings. You must click OK to apply the changes.
- Chirality maps are not active in Multiplayer, however those generated in Solo will be displayed. To avoid confusion, it is recommended to restart the game before going into MP: This will clear them from the display
- Requires: BS_Utils, BSML, SongCore. BS 1.18.0+

## Scores
- Scores will post to ScoreSaber under separate game mode leaderboards that everyone with this mod can play on!
- Leaderboards for ScoreSaber and Party Mode will change when switching game modes. They are saved and you can view them by selecting the corresponding game mode
- **For example:** You have set scores on InverseStandard then switch to play InverseOneSaber. The leaderboards will show InverseOneSaber scores. To see InverseStandard scores again, switch back to Standard mode using Mod Settings.

## Things To Note
- Walls are stripped from Noodle and ME maps.
- Pre-1.20.0 only: Can lag in menu when selecting maps with excessive events and objects (Chroma, wall maps). This is expected, please wait for it to finish loading

## What's In The Name?
/ka…™Ààr√¶l…™tiÀê/ Chirality is a geometric property where an object cannot be superimposed on its mirror image by any translation or rotation. It is important to chemistry, biology, physics, and math. Learn more about it here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality_(chemistry)
