# Chirality (MirrorMod)

*Hi there Miss Strimer can you play the hardest map in the game Reality Check Through the Skull but it's the inverse?*

Or, ever played true acc in the sky?

**A mod that generates inverted (horizontally, vertically, or mirror-inverse) maps for any non-360/90 map.
Available for Standard, One Saber, No Arrows and Lawless modes in Solo with ScoreSaber submission, Party Mode, OST and select DLCs. Each map can potentially generate 60 new difficulties!**

</p>

## How To Use
- Place Chirality.dll in Plugins folder
- Click on any map, try the three new arrow icons and have fun! Inverse can be pure chaos for some maps ^^
- Requires: BS_Utils, BSML, SongCore. BS 1.18.0+

**Use Mod Settings Menu:**
- To change the game mode (Standard, One Saber, No Arrows, or Lawless) that the mod will apply the mirroring to
- To enable and disable the mod
- **You must click OK to apply the changes. Mode changes for OST/DLC requires a game restart after clicking OK to take effect.**
- Mirrored maps are not active in Multiplayer, however those generated in Solo will be displayed. To avoid confusion, it is recommended to restart the game before going into MP: This will clear them from the display

## Scores
- Scores will post to ScoreSaber under separate game mode leaderboards that everyone with this mod can play on!
- Leaderboards for both ScoreSaber and Party Mode will change when switching game modes. They are saved and you can view them by selecting the corresponding game mode
- **For example:** You set scores on InverseStandard then switch to play InverseOneSaber. Your scores set on InverseStandard will be hidden and the leaderboard will show the InverseOneSaber scores. To see the InverseStandard scores again, switch back to Standard mode in Mod Settings.
- OST/DLC leaderboard is local Solo and Party Mode only

## Things To Note
- Walls in Noodle and ME maps are removed. There is a special mode for ME and maps with precision placement üòÅ
- Can lag in menu when selecting maps with excessive events and objects (Chroma, wall maps). This is expected, please wait for it to finish loading

## What's In The Name?
/ka…™Ààr√¶l…™tiÀê/ Chirality is a geometric property where an object cannot be superimposed on its mirror image by any translation or rotation. It is important to chemistry, biology, physics, and math. Learn more about it here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality_(chemistry)
