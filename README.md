# Chirality (MirrorMod)

*Hi Miss strimer can you play the hardest map in the game Reality Check Through the Skull but it's the inverse?*

Or, ever played true acc in the sky?

**A mod that generates mirrored (horizontally, vertically, or invert) maps for for any map.
Available for Standard, One Saber, No Arrows and Lawless modes in Solo with ScoreSaber submission and Party Mode. Each map can potentially generate 12 new difficulties!**

## How To Use
- Place Chirality.dll in Plugins folder
- Click on any map, try the three new gamemodes and have fun! Inverse can be pure chaos for some maps ^^
- To change the game mode difficulties that the mod will apply the mirroring to, close game, edit the `mode` field in `/Beat Saber/UserData/Chirality.json` to one of the values below, and restart game

Game Mode | Value
--- | ---
Standard | 0
OneSaber | 1
NoArrows | 2
Lawless | 3
- To enable or disable the mod, close game, edit the 'enabled' field in `/Beat Saber/UserData/Chirality.json` to `true` or `false` and restart game
- Mirrored maps are not active in Multiplayer, however those generated in Solo will be displayed. To avoid confusion, it is recommended to restart the game before going into MP: this will clear them from the display 

## Scores
- Scores will submit to ScoreSaber under separate game mode leaderboards that everyone with this mod can play on!
- Leaderboards for both ScoreSaber and Party Mode will change when switching game modes. They are saved and you can view them by selecting the corresponding game mode
- **For example:** You set scores on InvertStandard then switch to play InvertOneSaber. Your scores set on InvertStandard will be hidden and the leaderboard will show the InvertOneSaber scores. To see the InvertStandard scores again, switch back to Standard mode.

## Things To Note
- Walls in Noodle and ME maps are removed. There is a special mode for ME and some Noodle maps üòÅ
- Can stutter in menu when selecting maps with excessive events or objects (Chroma, Wall-art maps). This is expected, wait for it to finish loading

## What's In The Name?
/ka…™Ààr√¶l…™tiÀê/ Chirality is a geometric property where an object cannot be superimposed on its mirror image by any translation or rotation. It is important to chemistry, biology, phyics, and math. Learn more about it here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality_(chemistry)
