# Chirality (MirrorMod)

*Hi Ms strimer can you play the hardest map in the game Reality Check Through the Skull but it's the inverse?*

Or, ever played true acc in the sky?

**A mod that generates mirrored (horizontally, vertically, or inverse) maps for for any map.
Available for Standard, One Saber, No Arrows and Lawless modes in Solo with ScoreSaber submission and Party Mode. Each map can potentially generate 12 new difficulties!**

## How To Use
- Place Chirality.dll in Plugins folder
- Click on any map, try the three new gamemodes and have fun! Inverse can be pure chaos for some maps ^^
- To enable or disable the mod, quit the game, edit 'enabled' to Chirality.json in /Beat SAber/UserData `true` or `false` and restart game.
- To change the gamemode difficulties that the mod will apply the mirroring to, quit the game, edit the `mode` field in Chirality.json in /Beat SAber/UserData to one of the values below, and restart the game

Game Mode | Value
--- | ---
Standard | 0
OneSaber | 1
NoArrows | 2
Lawless | 3

## Scores
- Scores will submit to ScoreSaber under separate game mode leaderboards that everyone with this mod can play on
- Leaderboards for both ScoreSaber and Party Mode will change when switching game modes.
- For example: You set scores on InvertStandard then switch to play InvertOneSaber. Your scores set on InvertStandard will be hidden and the leaderboard will show the InvertOneSaber scores. To see the InvertStandard scores again, switch back to Standard mode.

## Things To Note
- Walls and events in Noodle and ME maps may be missing or do funny things in the mirror modes. Consider it a part of the surprise ^^
- May lag when selecting some wall-art Noodle, ME or other maps with an excessive number of objects
- This mod is incompatible with some maps containing custom data and will load forever. If that happens, select another map or turn off the mod to play that map normally

## How Do I Say The Name?
It is pronounced like kai-ral-ity. Chirality is the geometric property where an object cannot be superimposed on its mirror image by any translation or rotation. You can reaad more about it here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality_(chemistry)
